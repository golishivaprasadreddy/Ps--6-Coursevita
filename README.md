# MERN Starter Template

A starter template for building full-stack applications using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with **TypeScript** support for both frontend and backend.

### Technologies Used

#### **Client Side**

- **React (Vite)**: A fast, modern, and highly optimized build tool for React applications.
- **React Router DOM**: Used for handling client-side routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript, enabling better tooling, code reliability, and maintainability.

#### **Server Side**

- **Express with TypeScript**: A minimalist web framework for building RESTful APIs, enhanced with TypeScript support for better type safety.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.

### Features

- **Full-Stack MERN Application**: Complete setup for frontend (React) and backend (Express) to get started with MERN projects.
- **TypeScript Support**: Pre-configured with TypeScript for both the client and server to ensure type safety and better developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Quickly style your frontend using utility-first CSS classes.
- **Fast Development Setup**: Ready-to-use development environment for both the client and server with easy commands to run and manage both.
