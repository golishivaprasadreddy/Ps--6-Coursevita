# MERN Starter Template - Linux/Mac Setup

This guide will help you set up the **MERN Starter Template** on a **Linux** or **Mac** system.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (Install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Yarn** (Recommended for better compatibility and performance. To install Yarn via npm, run the following command):

    ```bash
    npm install --global yarn
    ```

- **Git** (Install it from [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krisnachaitanya/mern-starter.git <your_project>
    ```

    Make sure you are in the root/project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <your_project>  # Navigate to the project root directory
    ```

2. **Install dependencies for the client-side:**

    If you are using **Yarn**, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd client
    yarn install
    ```

    If you prefer **npm**, ensure you are in the root directory, then remove the existing `yarn.lock` file and run:

    ```bash
    cd client
    rm -rf node_modules
    rm yarn.lock
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install dependencies for the server-side:**

    Make sure you are in the root directory, then run:

    If using **Yarn**:

    ```bash
    cd server
    yarn install
    ```

    For **npm**, remove the `yarn.lock` file similarly:

    ```bash
    cd server
    rm -rf node_modules
    rm yarn.lock
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development servers:

1. **Start the client:**

    In your terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and run:

    ```bash
    cd client
    yarn start   # Or use npm if preferred: npm start
    ```

2. **Start the server:**

    Navigate to the `server` directory and run:

    ```bash
    cd server
    yarn start   # Or use npm if preferred: npm start
    ```
